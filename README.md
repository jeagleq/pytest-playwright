# 🎯 Pytest-Playwright Testing Project (UI + API)

This project is a comprehensive **Pytest-Playwright Testing** solution, combining UI and API testing capabilities. The project features a login functionality, state preservation, and integration with multiple reporting tools.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The project leverages the following technologies:

- **pytest-playwright**: For UI automation and browser interaction.
- **pytest**: As the core testing framework.
- **pytest-allure**: For generating detailed and interactive reports.
- **pytest-html**: For HTML-based reporting.
- **requests**: For API testing.
- **poetry**: For dependency management and virtual environment handling.

## ✨ Features

- **User Login and State Preservation**:

  - The user login functionality is implemented to save the state (e.g., cookies, sessions).
  - This state is reused in subsequent tests.
  - The state-saving logic is powered by fixtures defined in the `conftest.py` file.

- **Centralized Configuration**:

  - Credentials and base URLs (for both UI and API) are stored in `config.conf`.
  - These parameters are read using the `readConfig` file, which provides utility functions to pass configuration data into tests.

- **Framework Behavior Customization**:

  - Default command-line options, test paths, and markers are configured in the `pytest.ini` file.

- **Custom Logging**:

  - A `customLogger` file is included for detailed logging of test executions.

- **Page Object Model**:
  - The `pages` directory contains classes and methods for interacting with various application pages.
